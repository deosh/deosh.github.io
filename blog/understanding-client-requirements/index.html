                    <p>Assume this is your first conversation with the prospect and the beginning of your interview. It is helpful to ask questions pertaining to their requirement first as people are usually more comfortable describing what they want than what they have initially. Once they seem comfortable talking to you, you can transition into more personal information (i.e. financial).</p>

                    <blockquote>Connecting with the client on a personal level during this first interaction may ease any discomfort they have about revealing specific information. If possible, research the client and company before hand and use any common ground to relate to them in the form of a similar interest or anecdote.</blockquote>

                    <p>Use this initial contact to understand your client and establish that you are a professional with the skills and knowledge to assist them. This is the time to learn about their requirement, gauge their level of knowledge and experience, and begin to demonstrate your expertise through shared market knowledge and experience.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Changing Requirements</h2>

                    <p>If the requirements are too narrow or specific, it is your job to help expand their search criteria in any way possible (e.g. size, location, property type, etc.). This can drastically improve your searches while also help you to present opportunities not previously considered by your client.</p>

                    <p>If the requirements are too broad, help narrow the search by determining the prospect's preferences. Location, size and budget are the most typical constraints. If they are not constraints, try to determine their preferences.Please note, through-out the process (i.e. after the initial contact), requirements and criteria can change. A little patience and flexibility with clients can take you far, but do not be managed by their uncertainty. When a client changes their requirement, you can offer guidance in the form of alternate solutions. For instance, after viewing space, a client may decide they need additional square footage to accommodate a recent expansion. Seek alternative possibilities such as negotiating an expansion option to minimize their current amount with size flexibility at a later point. Alternatively, they may decide they need a shorter term in response to new logistic or economic uncertainties. Maybe a release or buyout clause would serve them better. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes value is less obvious. Maybe you just have a likeability factor that can help you close a great deal. Maybe your work ethic keeps your finger on the pulse of the market. Whatever the case, closely examine and write down your list. Determine what additional value you can add by furthering your education, skills and anything else you find to be of value to your clients. Once you have a clear understanding of what it is you really do, you can spend more time demonstrating your value rather than selling it.</p>

                    <blockquote>Search for flaws in their requirements, anticipate change and be prepared with solutions. This will save everyone time and help elevate your professionalism further.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Requirement Questions:</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>What type of business?</b></p>
                            <p>A clear understanding of the prospect's business model will help you to better understand their requirements. For example, city parking requirements may vary with the number of tables a restaurant has (i.e. quick service vs. restaurant). Alternatively, a call center service may operate around the clock. This may have an impact by limiting the search to buildings with 24/7 accessibility and HVAC .Understanding exactly what type of product or service, and how it will be delivered, will enable you to understand the actual requirement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Why are they looking for space?</b></p>
                            <p>Is it a new business? Are they expanding or downsizing? Is their current lease up? The why is often just as important as the what. It will provide insight into the urgency and overall feasibility of the deal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Are they working with other brokers?</b></p>
                            <p>If the answer is yes, tread carefully. Do they currently have any offers out or interest in a particular property? There are different views on how to handle these situations. Regardless, it will require judgment on your part. Over time you will develop a system and be comfortable handling these scenarios.</p>


                            <p>Get a sense of why they are using more than one broker. If it is to increase their chances of finding more properties, explain to them that this may not be the case. Depending on the client and deal size, competing brokers are often less likely to put more time and effort into a deal once their chances of closing have been reduced. Additionally, with increased accessibility to information, there is increased likelihood that brokers have access to the same information. The resulting overlap of short listed properties may spark disputes in which broker was the procuring cause of the deal. Is their current broker not cutting it, and if so why? Can you add value where they are falling short? Is the deal worth the risk?  Refer to the Exclusive Agreement section.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading">Note on exclusives</h2>

                            <p>Some brokers are uncomfortable asking for an exclusive agreement and some may find them unnecessary, opting for an old fashioned handshake instead.  However, many brokers will not work without an exclusive agreement. Although it may be more difficult when starting out, this can be an effective philosophy. An exclusive agreement sets a precedent of safe brokerage and control of your time. Regardless of your approach, remember, this is your lively hood. Do not give your time to anyone who does not respect that.</p>

                            <blockquote>
                                If you do not require your prospect to sign an exclusive agreement, don't be shy about letting them know that you are waiving this requirement for them. Also let them know this is your lively hood and describe how much time you put in and what you expect from them. Find out if they intend to use you regardless of where they find the property. Often this will become clearer as the relationship grows. You do not want to come across as pushy, but you do need to set the right tone early. You might begin by saying to your client:

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                "As I put a lot of time in for my clients, and because I'm not requesting that you sign an exclusive agreement, I do ask that you remain direct with me throughout the leasing process."
                            </blockquote>

                            <h2 class="section-heading">Set a time limit</h2>

                            <p>Some brokers anticipate donating a certain amount of goodwill, their time and effort in particular, but will set a limit. For instance, donating a maximum of 10 hours of work for a client before presenting an exclusive representation agreement. If they do not agree, then say good luck and walk away politely. This gives the agent the opportunity to prove credibility before drawing the line. It also gives the agent a chance to observe the client's behavior and responsiveness After all, this is a relationship business and you both have the right to set your own expectations.</p>

                            <p>Alternatively, you might consider using an event to trigger the exclusive agreement conversation. For example, after the first property tour or after sending the second shortlist of available properties. Either way, try to stay disciplined with whatever method works for you. After all, there are other clients out there that will value your dedication and recognize the benefits of a mutual commitment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What type of space are they looking for (e.g. office, retail, industrial)?</b>

                            <p>If the requirement is an office, are they looking for creative, traditional or hybrid? If it's a retail requirement, is it a stand alone, shopping center, mixed use, etc. Figure out exactly what they are seeking and keep in mind that their criteria may be misguided. Be prepared for the criteria to change.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>How much space do they need?</b>

                            <p>Tenants will often throw out a broad estimate or range such as 5,000 - 10,000 sq. ft. If that's the case, you might need to circle back and refine this range, once you understand their other requirements. If they are unsure, ask if they need assistance in determining their optimal space.</p>

                            <blockquote>You can use the office space planning tool which incorporates the rentable square feet and circulation multiplier (available <a target="_blank" href="../../templates/spreadsheets/office-space-analysis/index.html">here</a>) to help determine and show how much space is required.</blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What geographic area or market do they prefer and why?</b>

                            <p>Determine why they require a certain area (e.g. logistics, commute time, demographics, existing clientele, etc.). Further understanding this will assist you in expanding the search criteria later on if needed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What is their budget?</b>

                            <p>They may give you a monthly range or a price per square foot. Either way, gauge how realistic their price point is in the market they desire. You can use this to further determine their level of experience. Also determine if this is their rent budget, or inclusive of other charges (e.g. CAM, NNN, Parking, etc.)</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Are there other requirements or preferences?</b>

                            <p>Determine other requirements or preferences such as parking, power, clear height, signage, etc. The tenant will often not know or think of anything else to include in their needs. Try to match their requirement with what you might foresee being a concern down the line. For example, a manufacturer might require specific column spacing to accommodate their machinery.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>How long of a lease term do they want?</b>

                            <p>You might consider asking: "what type of term are you looking for between 3-5 years?" Yes, the lease length correlates with your commission. If they are looking for a short term lease, it is up to you to decide if it is worth pursuing. Figure out why they want a short term. Do they require flexibility due to uncertain operations? Do they require more space down the line in which an expansion option could help? Either way, remind them that you will likely be able to negotiate a more favorable outcome based on a longer term. That said, you must always keep their best interest in mind. Not only is it a fiduciary responsibility, it is good business practice. In other words, do not push for a 5 year deal when there is a more favorable 2 year deal on the table. If it ultimately is not worth the time involved, walk away or refer them elsewhere. If you do take on the short term lease and do a great job, then there is likely another deal waiting for you sooner.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What is their timing?</b>

                            <p>If they are not ready to lease within a couple of months, you need to explain that the spaces and market may change. If their timing is too urgent (i.e. 30 days), you need to educate them on the general timing of the process. Clear the way of future surprises and problems as much as possible by educating your client.</p>
                        </li>
