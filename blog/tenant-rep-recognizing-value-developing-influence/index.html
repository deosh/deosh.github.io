                    <p>Many people are not aware that tenant reps exist. Moreover, they might not understand why they need you. Empower yourself by helping your client understand that a good tenant rep:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Has in-depth knowledge of leasing transactions and processes.</li>
                        <li>Has updated exposure to their market, it's trends and common deal terms.</li>
                        <li>Has the tools and relationships to obtain the best deals.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Value</h2>

                    <p>How can you demonstrate your own value if you don't know what you bring to the table? First off, remember that you are helping your prospective clients to navigate a complex process filled with jargon, procedures and market trends. As a leasing agent it's your responsibility to convey the current market trends to your client. In this capacity, you are a market advisor. All the while, you are saving them time and money... and what does your service cost your client? Assuming you are compensated by the landlord, nothing!</p>

                    <p>Value can also be a personal characteristic that sets you apart from other tenant reps. Ask yourself what skills, knowledge and abilities you possess that can help your clients. Do you have proficient knowledge with building codes? Do you have experience with space planning? Are you an expert negotiator?</p>

                    <p>Sometimes value is less obvious. Maybe you just have a likeability factor that can help you close a great deal. Maybe your work ethic keeps your finger on the pulse of the market. Whatever the case, closely examine and write down your list. Determine what additional value you can add by furthering your education, skills and anything else you find to be of value to your clients. Once you have a clear understanding of what it is you really do, you can spend more time demonstrating your value rather than selling it.</p>

                    <blockquote> To add value, compile a list of respected and highly ranked service providers to refer (e.g. attorneys, CPA's, contractors, space planners, moving companies, printers, graphic designers, etc.). Make sure you trust your referrals as their service will reflect on you.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Influence</h2>

                    <p>Without influence, you are at your client's mercy. You need to get an idea of how much influence you will be able to develop during your first conversation. It will be up to you to position yourself in their eyes as the market expert. To do so, you need to convey that leasing is a time consuming and involved process, and you are the expert to alleviate this burden for them.</p>

                    <p>Agents have begun to take on more of an advisory role with their clients. In staying current with this shift, you need to find out:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Will they listen to your advice?</li>
                        <li>Will they follow your advice?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Advisement does little good if it goes unheard, but this is not about controlling your client. Rather, it's about controlling your own deals by determining the level of respect you command from your clients. While a relationship may take time to build, you should position yourself to command respect immediately. Some red flags to watch out for may include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The client talks over you.</li>
                        <li>They think they are the expert.</li>
                        <li>They draw from personal real estate experience which is outdated.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Personality conflicts aside, you can overcome these obstacles simply by being more knowledgeable. Many clients assume that size, price and location are the only determining factors for leasing. While they are important, you need to educate them on some of the complexities of leasing. This is often accomplished just by asking the requirement and qualification questions described earlier. Your expertise will begin to be established as you take them through these questions and relay current market standards in contrast to their preferences.</p>

                    <blockquote>Use personal anecdotes to describe different scenarios to your client. For example, rather than saying there are provisions in the lease to be aware of and discuss with their attorney, you could relay a personal success story. For example, "I saved X amount of dollars for a client when their landlord sold their building because I had previously negotiated a cap on any NNN increases." Personal anecdotes demonstrate value through experience. </blockquote>

                    <p>Please keep in mind, without knowledge you have no right to influence. Experience will provide the most valuable assets including broker and landlord relationships, property and market familiarity and past deal references. However, you have to begin somewhere. Pool together knowledge from colleagues and perform in-depth market analyses. This will give you a starting point to begin forming your relationships. Furthermore, sometimes you need to know when to stay out of the way. Let the deal progress and do not push to add value where you cannot.</p>
