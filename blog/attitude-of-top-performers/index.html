                    <p>The prospect of creating wealth in CRE attracts many people. Although it's obtainable, it is not for everyone. CRE is tough, especially in the beginning, but this doesn't mean you will not enjoy the challenge. However, it will depend upon your attitude.</p>

                    <p>Don't worry, this is not a "if you believe it, you can achieve it" style article. Rather, it's an acknowledgement that attitude is a systemic part of success, or failure. There are qualities that are commonly found in top commercial agents. Whether they are inherent or cultivated, these qualities are components of an attitude primed for results. Although the qualities seem clich√© at face value, they form a dynamic relationship. Each quality is strengthened and supported by the next. The result: a mental architecture for long term effectiveness.</p>

                    <p>There is a reason so many people try to get into commercial real estate, and why so many drop out. There are serious obstacles and to overcome them you need the right mindset. Some of the major challenges agents face include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Survival</b> - the first few years with little to no income while building your business.</li>
                        <li><b>Rejection</b> - for every yes you may hear twenty no's.</li>
                        <li><b>Disappointment</b> - watching deals falling apart just before completion.</li>
                        <li><b>Exhaustion</b> - the hours can be long and intense.</li>
                        <li><b>Competition</b> - the strong survive and often have tight footholds in the market.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Such challenges tend to weed out many new agents. Despite many different personalities types and skill sets, the hardships of CRE filter a select few to endure a long and successful career. They share an attitude built of similar characteristics including:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Determination</h2>

                    <p>The ones who last in CRE are fueled by determination. They work towards exceeding their own objectives. Resilience and relentlessness shield them from distraction, defeat and exhaustion. Whatever the motivation, be it pressure or passion, determination is a driving factor for success. A good rule of thumb is to not leave the office until you have scheduled at least one meeting for another day.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Discipline</h2>

                    <p>Self discipline is mandatory. Once the proper habits and procedures for success are identified, they must be actualized.  The successful agent creates their plan for growth, and then they follow it rigorously. They habitually define their day to day activities, and prioritize them accordingly. They also stay disciplined managing their money and are able to survive, or even thrive when the market tanks. They keep stress minimized by managing their personal time and activities.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Discipline</h2>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Self Confidence</h2>

                    <p>In the CRE world, confidence is ubiquitous. Although brokers will sometimes overcompensate with aggressiveness, or just outright cockiness, you need the confidence to stand your ground. Please keep in mind, this is not always an inherit trait, and that is ok. Confidence can be forged. Investing in knowledge is the foundation for maneuvering in the CRE arena comfortably. If you need improvement in this area, you are already on the right track. You will be dealing with some very savvy people. Brokers learn to detect weakness in others just to survive in CRE, especially when they have to share their commission. Learning your craft inside and out helps even the playing field.</p>

                    <p>Even though you are leasing, and your service is generally at no charge to your client, you are selling yourself. You are selling your competence, expertise, fortitude and even your general appeal. You must believe in yourself if others are going to trust you and you must trust yourself to ultimately do the right thing. You may consider a stoic approach. Toughening up and disciplining yourself in key areas may provide the edge you need to pursue that high profile meeting, or push back when necessary.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Growth</h2>

                    <p>Top performers are constantly striving for personal and professional growth. As they directly affect each other, it is natural to find this ambition inherent in successful agents. It is based on a desire for improvement. The agent who continuously strives to be better is far more likely to actually be better. Whether we are talking about knowledge, skill sets, finances, relationships or deal flow, the successful are monitoring their own growth. These interval improvements help fuel motivation and keep the agent on track with the larger scale objectives.</p>

                    <p>Exercise tends to be the preferred method among brokers for maintaining health and minimizing stress. A consistent workout schedule will help improve your attitude, provide additional energy, strength, and the confidence to get the job done.</p>

                    <p>Despite a diverse schedule, top performers develop a tolerance for certain mundane and repetitive tasks because they have identified what works. They develop a willingness to narrow their focus because they already see the big picture. </p>
